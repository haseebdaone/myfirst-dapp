# My First React Dapp

I have an interest in Blockchain technology and Cryptocurrencies and have been learning React for a little while now so I thought I'd learn some Solidity and Web3Js to just play around and see what Blockchain technology (in this case Smart contracts) is about.<br/>This is the first DApp (Decentralized application) I have made and it's pretty simple, all it does is it saves a message the user inputs and that message is stored on the Blockchain (immutability stuff happening here) which is then retrieved and displayed on the screen.<br/>The main aim of this learn how all of the following technologies work together to make a DApp and possibly make a more complicated DApp in the future.

### Technologies used

* ReactJs
* Solidity
* Web3Js
* Node and npm

I also used the Remix a Solidity IDE to write the Solidity contract, deploy the contract on the Rinkbey Test Network and to get the contract ABI (Application Binary Interface) so that my instance of Web3 can interact with the deployed contract.

### How to use

If you are not using Google Chrome then download it here: https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/  
Then make sure you have the Metamask Chrome extension from here: https://metamask.io/  

Once you have created an account on Metamask make sure you have selected Rinkbey Test Network on Metamask (where the contract is deployed) to use the DApp: https://fierce-reef-85256.herokuapp.com/  

To get Ether in your account for the Rinkbey Test Network please go here: https://faucet.rinkeby.io/  
(note: its not real money)
